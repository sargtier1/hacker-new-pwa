# Hacker News Clone

### Goals
Build a hacker news clone with custom CSS-in-JS. I used a really nifty method of recursively calling the comment component on itself to give comments a classic forum style. The main goal of the app was to build a PWA that will turn into a mobile app on mobile. This method has been deprecated by google, so I will need to refactor. It still works, and is currently deployed. 

### Features 
  * Server side rendering with Next.js
  * Custom CSS 
  * Service workers + manifest.json

  *** DUE TO SW_PRECACHE BEING DEPRECATED MY PWA DOES NOT WORK ***
  * Progressive web app (WIP)
  * Mobile app view (WIP)
  * Module story pop up (WIP)
